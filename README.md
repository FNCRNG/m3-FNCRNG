 Sample Android app for Capstone Research Milestone
 
 Weighted average Pokemon Stat calculator
 
 Written by Nicholas Mueller

      This simple app takes a series of 6 numbers from the user
      these values represent a Pokemon's Individual Values, a
      set of numbers ranging from 0-31 which set a baseline for
      that Pokemon's respective manifested stat.

     As an average, the number is meant to show a generalized value
      to represent the overall potential of the Pokemon; however, in nearly
      all cases, a Pokemon will only ever use either its Attack or Sp. Attack
      stat, whichever is higher. Therefore, by including an irrelevant number
      to a running average, the effective average stat is fluffed out to appear
      either worse or better than the Pokemon will become in practice.

      This app makes a simple comparison to determine if the Attack and Sp. Attack
      differ by a factor greater than 15% of the greater stat. If so, the weaker stat
      is removed from the calculation, and the Pokemon's new weighted average stat is
      displayed.
